Iris is a machine learning model that uses support vector machines (SVMs) to classify different types of iris species based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The model is designed to predict the species of an iris flower based on these measurements, which can be useful for various applications such as botanical research and plant classification.
