# IRIS
### Introduction:
Iris is a machine learning model that uses support vector machines (SVMs) to classify different types of iris species based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The model is designed to predict the species of an iris flower based on these measurements, which can be useful for various applications such as botanical research and plant classification.

### How Iris Works:
Iris uses support vector machines (SVMs) to classify different types of iris species. SVMs are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. The SVM algorithm creates a hyperplane or a boundary that separates the different classes in the feature space. The goal is to find a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes, i.e., the distance between the hyperplane and the closest points from each class.

### Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Iris uses the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset includes three classes of iris flowers: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica. The dataset is preprocessed to remove any missing or incomplete data and is split into training and testing sets.

### Model Training and Evaluation:
Iris's machine learning model is trained using the training set and evaluated using the testing set. The SVM algorithm is used to create a hyperplane that separates the different classes of iris flowers based on their feature values. The model is optimized using hyperparameter tuning to improve the accuracy of the predictions. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix and F1 score.

### Conclusion:
Iris is a machine learning model that uses support vector machines (SVMs) to classify different types of iris species based on their feature values. The model is trained using the Iris dataset and optimized using hyperparameter tuning to improve the accuracy of the predictions. The user interface is simple and easy to use, allowing users to input iris flower samples and get a prediction of their species. This model can be useful for various applications such as botanical research and plant classification.
